# RL_Projects

### NB: Most of the notebooks are inspired/copied from - https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL
### Most of the algorithms are implemented as I go along with the Practical Reinforcement Learning Course on Coursera
### Linked here - https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl/

## I've tested these algorithms on different Gym environments and gonna use it for my own project, so created this repo

Algorithms currently in the repo(or those I've studied):
1. Crossentropy
2. Deep Crossentropy
3. Value Iteration
4. Q-Learning with \e - greedy exploration
5. SARSA
6. Expected Value SARSA with \e - greedy exploration

Some basic implementations of Reinforcement Learning:
1. {14-12-18} CartPole-V0 using Deep Crossentropy
2. {15-12-18} LunarLander-V2 using Deep Crossentropy
3. {18-12-18} Frozen Lake using Value Iteration
4. {22-12-18} Added Crossentropy Algorithm
5. {23-12-18} Added Deep Crossentropy Algorithm
6. {23-12-18} Taxi-V2 using Crossentropy
7. {24-12-18} Added Value Iteration Algorithm
8. {24-12-18} Added Q-learning with Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm
9. {26-12-18} Lunar Lander-V2 using Q Learning
