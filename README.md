# RL_Projects

## I've tested these algorithms on different Gym environments and used it for my own projects, so I created this repo to collect them

Algorithms currently in the repo(or those I've studied):
1. Crossentropy
2. Deep Crossentropy
3. Value Iteration
4. Q-Learning with e - greedy exploration
5. SARSA
6. Expected Value SARSA with e-greedy exploration
7. Q-Learning with Experience Replay
8. Deep Q-Learning on TF1.x and TF2
9. Deep Q-Learning on TF2 with Experience replay and Target network
10. REINFORCE - Policy Gradient algorithm on TF1.x and TF2
11. Double Q-Learning on TF2 with Experience replay
12. Advantage Actor-Critic on TF2
13. Proximal Policy Optimization
14. Twin Delayed DDPG
